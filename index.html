    <h2>Sup am BrunoGG</h2>
    <p>Hey! I am BrunoGG. I am just a high schooler who totally loves tech. I have been messing around with coding since 2018, and I'm always down to check out new tech stuff. Other than programming, I'm also into playing guitar, coming up with new ideas, and 3D modeling. Currently, I'm getting into software and web development. I really try to level up my skills as I keep learning. I always hunt for fresh challenges and chances to learn something new.</p>
